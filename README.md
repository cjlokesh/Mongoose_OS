## The examples are the basics of mongoose os to getting started and ease with API reference.

####**Examples**####:
*Core API*: 
          GPIO, Timers, ISR, Device configuration, RTOS tasks, File system configuration, etc.
*Networking*:
          WIFI modes(STA  and AP), HTTP, HTTP - server, HTTPS, OTA, Web sockets.
*Protocols*:
          MQTT, I2C, SPI.
*RPC (Remote procedure call)*:

By the combination of the above examples, building the projects is facile.

I am thankful to **Mr.Dhanraj** and **Mr.Prem** for guidance.
